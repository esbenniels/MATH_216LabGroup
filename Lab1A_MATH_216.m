% Equilibrium Solutions:
% Answer: In each case, the equilibrium solution appears to be equal to the
% k value included in the equation.

% For function1 (r = 1, k = 3): the equilibrium solution was y = 3
% For function1 (r = 2, k = 3): the equilibrium solution was y = 3
% For function1 (r = 1, k = 4): the equilibrium solution was y = 4
% For function1 (r = 2, k = 4): the equilibrium solution was y = 4

% R determines the initial growth rate of the function, while K models the
% equilibrium value that the equation reaches.

% Yes, different initial conditions can change concavity and growth rate of
